# Introduction
# One of the most impressive aspects of Ruby is its metaprogramming capabilities.
# As a dynamic language, Ruby gives you the freedom to define methods and even classes during runtime.
# Metaprogramming with Ruby, one can do in a few minutes what other languages may take hours to do.
# By cleverly planning your code and applying the techniques mentioned here, you’ll be able to write code that is DRYer, lighter, more intuitive and more scalable.

# This tutorial assumes you are already familiar with the following concepts:
# -> Ruby Classes and class inheritance
# -> Instance methods and instance variables
# -> Raising exceptions

# and standard Ruby notations:
# to show that method_name is a method in MyClass
# $ MyClass#method_name

# to show the return value of a method 
# $ =>
